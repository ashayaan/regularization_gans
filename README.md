# RegGAN

We propose a framework for generating samples from a probability distribution that differs from the probability distribution of the training set. We use an adversarial process that simultaneously trains three networks, a generator and two discriminators. We refer to this new model as regularized generative adversarial network (RegGAN). We evaluate RegGAN on a synthetic dataset composed of gray scale images and we further show that it can be used to learn some pre-specified notions in topology (basic topology properties). The work is motivated by practical problems encountered while using generative methods in the art world.
